# Matrix-Led-16x16
Sketch for Arduino, Esp8266 and others to create an image in a led matrix of any size

<h1>First step</h1>

In an image editor make a drawing of any size equal to your matrix, and then save

<h2>Second step</h2>

Open the program "lcd-image-converter" va file open and select your image.

<h2>Third step</h2>

Go to options and select convert, in type put color in image put block size in 24 bit, depending on your matrix change the line scan direction.

<h2>Fourth step</h2>

Press the show preview button, copy the code and replace it in the arduino code.

<h1>Congratulations just compile and it's working.</h1>

Ps: Depending on your matrix you will have to use a different script (it was my case), so I left it annotated in a text file, when converting, just put in the custom script option and paste the custom script

Ps: This video explains much better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1iVtLQOZOImas my code is changed so you can use a button to go through the loops so it's your choice.

(Hope this helps)
